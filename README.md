# Runners Unidos

Runners Unidos is a full-stack web application I built to serve as an information hub for a local running club in Dallas, Texas. The site helps keep our running community connected by providing easy access to schedules, events, and more. Here’s a breakdown of the key features:

- **Home Page:** On mobile devices, users are welcomed with a video showing members of Runners Unidos gathering and running together at various locations. Below the video, there’s a brief description of the club, the upcoming schedule with an integrated Google Maps view, and a section that highlights the latest event.

- **Schedule Page:** Users can view the details for upcoming runs, including location and time, with a handy "Get Directions" button that links directly to Google Maps for easy navigation.
- **Events:** This page displays upcoming events as well as past events. Each event has its own page with more details, including a photo gallery and a description of what went down at the event.
- **Gallery:** A collection of photos capturing our members in action during runs. It’s a great way to relive the energy and fun of our past events.
- **Join Us:** If users want to join the club, they can fill out a form on this page, and their information gets logged into the backend database.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing:** Built with Next.js for server-side rendering, providing efficient and seamless navigation.
